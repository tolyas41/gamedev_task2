Task 2. Constructors Destructors


Develop a class for working with matrices. The class must have the following properties:

All internal data-elements of the class responsible for storing information about the matrix, are placed in dynamic memory.

Contain a type conversion constructor that converts the directly specified numerical constant with a sign into a class object.

Contain a type conversion constructor that converts a directly specified 2-dimensional array with numbers into a class object.

Implement the correct work with objects of the developed class when copying, moving and initializing.

Contain the function of converting the internal structure of the object to a string, so that later you can intuitively show the result on the screen. String format: [a,b; c,d; …], where a, b, c, d, … – numbers.

Contain a type conversion constructor that converts the directly specified character type string (char *), which is a string representation of a mathematical object, into a class object. The conversion process must verify that the input is correct.

Contain a destructor to free all allocated memory.
